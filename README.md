# EEE102-Term-Project-Automatic-Ticket-Scanner
This file was created to serve as inspiration to those working on their own FPGA digital programming projects. This specific project was implemented using the following components: a Digilent BASYS3 FPGA (including its integrated modules such as the clock and the 7-segment display), an SG90 servo motor, a piezoelectric buzzer, a UART cable and a laptop. The project itself was mainly implemented on Vivado in VHDL and on Spyder using Python. This project can be used as a guide to implement other projects utilizing similar components. If any of the provided files are corrupted, you can use the project report provided with the project to obtain specific scripts used in each file as well as to understand how individual modules work and connect with one and other.
